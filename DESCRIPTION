Title: a simple method for trajectory evaluation
Version: 0.1.0

Description: A package for evaluating the continuity of inferred single-cell trajectories using multiple metrics, including differential gene expression testing, average expression correlation, and gene expression enthalpy. Associated visualizations for pairwise bin comparisons are included. May be useful for selecting trajectories for downstream validation in complex biological systems, as well as comparisons of trajectories inferred by different algorithms.
